# ROB311Labs
Labs for the ROB311: Artifical Intelligence Course at U of T

**Lab 1**: Implementing State Space Search with different strategies such as breadth first search, bidirectional search, and A* search.

**Lab 2**: Inference Engine, N-Queens, RRT Path Planning.

**Lab 3**: Decision Tree Learning, Rock Paper Scissors agent (one implementation with a CEM Network, the other implementation uses a mix of Q Learning and Bayesian Predictions). My agent (using the second implementation) placed in the top 5 in a tournament held among a class of 72.

**Lab 4**: Markov Decision Processes - Implementations of Value Iteration and Policy Iteration.

**Final Project**: Reinforcement Learning for the OpenAI Cartpole environment using only Numpy. My agent was a simple implementation of Monte Carlo Policy Gradients.
